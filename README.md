# Smart Recommendation System

A robust and scalable recommendation system designed to offer personalized suggestions based on both content-based and collaborative filtering models. This system employs multiple machine learning techniques to provide high-quality recommendations to users. 

## Overview

The **Smart Recommendation System** leverages:
1. **Content-based Filtering** - Recommends items similar to those the user has shown interest in, based on item features.
2. **Collaborative Filtering** - Recommends items based on user-item interactions, utilizing user preferences and behavior.

Additionally, the system is integrated with an **evaluation module** to assess model performance using accuracy metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

## Features

- **Hybrid Recommendation**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering methods.
- **Scalable Model**: Suitable for large datasets with millions of user-item interactions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Built-in model evaluation functions for performance assessment.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add more recommendation models or data processing steps.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imabhnv/Smart-Recommendation-System.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Smart-Recommendation-System
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Load Data**: Ensure that you have the data files in the `data/` directory.

2. **Run the Recommendation System**:

   The `app.py` file runs the system and produces recommendations based on the provided dataset.

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Evaluation**: Use the `evaluate_model()` function from the `evaluation/model_evaluation.py` to assess your recommendation models' performance.

   ```python
   from evaluation.model_evaluation import evaluate_model
   
   # Assuming you have your content and user-item matrices
   evaluate_model(content_matrix, model_type='content')
   evaluate_model(user_item_matrix, model_type='collaborative')
   ```

## Example

Once the system is up and running, you can view the recommendation results in your console or modify the system to integrate with a front-end application for a user interface.

```python
from smart_recommender import SmartRecommender

# Initialize and load data
recommender = SmartRecommender()
recommender.load_sample_data()

# Build models
recommender.build_content_based_model()
recommender.build_collaborative_filtering_model()

# Evaluate models
results = evaluate_recommender_models(recommender.content_matrix, recommender.user_item_matrix)
print(results)
```

## Evaluation

- **Content-based model**: Evaluates based on item similarity and features.
- **Collaborative filtering model**: Evaluates based on user-item interaction patterns.

## Dependencies

The following Python packages are required for the system to run:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
